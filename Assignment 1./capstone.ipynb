This project demonstrates \nabout how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world.\nDuring the project, I have learnt to be creative in when data are not readily available by surfing, mining the web and parsing HTML \ncodes. I had used Python and pandas library to manipulate data, which helped in refining my skills for exploring and analyzing data. \nFinally, my experience with the Folium library to get maps of geospatial data and to communicate with my results and findings gave \nme the sweetest flavour. This course completely changed me and I could say I achieved my goal, it wasn't waste of time. \n"
